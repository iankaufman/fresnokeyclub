      	<h2> What is Key Club?</h2>
          <p>Key Club International is a youth service-leadership organization sponsored by Kiwanis International. It is the oldest and largest service program for high school students. It is entirely student-led at every level: Key Club International, districts, and individual clubs are all run by students.</p>
          <p>Our organization was the inspired vision of California State Commissioner of Schools Albert C. Olney, and vocational education teacher Frank C. Vincent, who together worked to establish the first Key Club at Sacramento High School in California on May 7, 1925. Today, Key Club exists on almost 5,000 high school campuses, 31 different countries, primarily in the United States and Canada. It has also grown internationally to the Caribbean nations, Central and South America, and most recently to Asia and Australia. </p>

	       	<h3> Major Emphasis</h3>
	       	<p>Key Club International brings together all Key Club's members' efforts and energies into an area that makes an international impact through the Major Emphasis, "Children: Their Future, Our Focus.” The Major Emphasis unites Key Clubs under the banner of service that deals with the most important part of our community, our youth.The Key Club service initiative is the hands-on element of the Major Emphasis. All of the hands-on service provided to children by Key Club International members is directed to a single area of need, to make a substantial impact.</p>

	       	<h3> Current Initiative</h3>
	       	<p>The current service initiative, The Eliminate Project, allows Key Clubbers joining forces with Kiwanis International and UNICEF to eliminate maternal and neonatal tetanus from our Earth.Each year, Key Club International teams up with its three partner organizations, March of Dimes, Children’s Miracle Network and UNICEF, for the fundraising element of the Major Emphasis. As you plan your club’s service programming for the year, keep these organizations in mind. Each Key Club is encouraged to participate with our partners as we join together to make a difference in the lives of children.</p>
